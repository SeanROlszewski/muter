            Muter noticed that your test suite initially failed to compile or produced a test failure.
            
            This is usually due to misconfiguring the "executable" and "arguments" options inside of your muter.conf.json.
            Alternatively, it could mean you have a nondeterministic test failure in your test suite.
            
            We recommend you try your settings out in a terminal prior to using Muter for the best configuration experience.
            We also recommend removing tests which you know to be flaky from the set of tests that Muter exercises.
