⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️  Muter has encountered an error  ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️
Muter wasn't able to discover any code it could mutation test.

This is likely caused by misconfiguring Muter, usually by excluding a directory that contains your code.


⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️  See the Muter error log above this line  ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️
